Other better approaches for the same problem that you find out after discussing with your team mates. I would highly recommend to participate in CPL contest organized by O(1) coding club.",

None of the interviews I gave had gone without solving a coding problem, so I would suggest to improve your competitive coding skill if you are not good in it and I would highly recommend to be part of O(1) Coding Club and take active participation in various contests and sessions organized by them.",

It made a good habit of solving problems on daily basis and helped us to have a grip on competitive coding questions. As far as the interviews are concerned, the videos uploaded by O(1) were very helpful particular to each company, where they told us what exactly do they expect and how to prepare for it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for mentorship, guidance about placements, go for O(1).',
